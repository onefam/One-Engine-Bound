    Variously construed, these processes constituted something called the
## scientific method.
  Sometimes thought to have been invented in the 17th century, this was the method by which scientists discovered true generalizations about and explanations for natural phenomena. Or if not exactly true, at least approximations to the truth. And if not certain approximations to then at least highly probable ones. Something of this sort we had all been taught, and we all knew that attempts to refine that understanding of scientific method and what it produced had encountered deep, though isolated, difficulties that were not, after centuries of effort, responding to treatment. It was those difficulties which
drove us to observations of scientific life and to history, and we were
considerably disconcerted by what we found there.

     If museums become agents for social change, then they lose that role of bearing witness to the world today and how it has got to where it is.Ian Jones, Founder, ICOM/CAMOC In response to a major theme propounded by several delegates to the 2016 International Council of Museums (ICOM)'s triennial meeting in Milan as well as to encourage colleagues to review the intent of the 2009 Torreon Declaration, I would like to initiate a conversation regarding the role of museums in social justice and immigration, particularly when that challenge is applied to smaller—and most particularly, city—museums worldwide.
   I should emphasize that, as a member of ICO's Committee for the Collections and Activities of Museums of Cities (CAMOC), I write from the perspective of city and history museums and do not, therefore, presume to speak from the perspective of other ICOM committees. Since at least the late 1960s (when this author entered the museum field), members of the museum profession have paid increasing attention to the realities of refugees and immigration, through collecting, exhibits, and public programs that engage immigrants themselves and longtime members of their host communities. 
   One look at our collective bookshelves and we see a host of publications—books, essays, articles, pamphlets, technical leaflets from AAM, ICOM, AASLH, etc.—that illuminate how generations of museum professionals have informed themselves and our audiences about the issues of immigration and the museum's role in, as the 2009 Torreon Declaration states, “promoting diversity and human rights, respect and equality for people of all origins, beliefs, and background.” The writings of Edward Alexander (Museum Masters, 1983), The Smithsonian Institution (Report of the Blue Ribbon Commission on the National Museum of American History, 2002), The American Association of Museums (A Museums & Community Toolkit, 2002), Gail Anderson (Reinventing the Museum, 2004), are a fraction of the authors and publishers whose works, for decades, have explored the rationale and techniques by which museums must engage diverse audiences and address the many facets of inclusion, social justice, and migration. Since at least the 1970s, one could find countless exhibits and public programs by museums of all sizes that have sought to inform and instruct local, national, and international audiences about the myriad challenges faced by immigrants and their host communities.
  At the ICOM General Conference this past July, delegates heard a number of excellent speakers from several countries address the issues of museums as interveners in social justice challenges, and museums as actively engaging their communities in contemporary debates about migration (especially as the latter relates to European communities). In particular, the July 6 general session on “The Social Role of Museums: New Migrations, New Challenges,” the same day's sessions of CAMOC, and no doubt within other ICOM committees’ sessions, social justice and migration/immigration were thought-provoking topics of lively discussion. 
  Some speakers went so far as to suggest that the work of museums in the 21st century ought to move beyond exhibitions and public programs on these topics to a social justice mission that involves active intervention that can produce social justice.
  More than 30 years ago, as an urban planner and historian, I began merging issues of immigration, future planning, and historical thinking with objects in my own museum work. During the 1990s, as director of a state historical museum in the United States, I helped organize exhibits that explored the history of immigration to the American West. Most people expected the classical narrative about the wagon-train pioneers of the 1840s. Instead, over the course of a number of exhibits, we focused on the 10,000-year story of people coming to our part of the world: First Nations people, American pioneers, and immigrants from China and Japan, Europe and Russia, South and Central America, and elsewhere.
   Today, one of the museums I direct (and use in classes on museum studies) focuses on cities; their history, their planning, and social—as well as environmental, economic, and political—justice. The museum of cities that I direct is deeply invested in these endeavors though this is hardly its primary purpose. One of my museum's major partners is Portland, Oregon's immigrant and refugee organization. Its members and volunteers have contributed to our exhibits since the museum's founding 15 years ago. Yet, while we believe the museum, just as other city museums, has a responsibility to collect, interpret, and offer programs about immigration, we see it as one, but not our primary, subject area. 
  
  ´´´
  Therefore, when it comes to the proposition that museums of the 21st century ought to consider refocusing their missions on social justice, I pause. I was attracted to the museum field in the late 1960s because the profession is broad and inclusive. As time has passed, I have become increasingly interested and active in the belief that museums ought to be partners with their communities’ agents of social justice. I also believe that it is elemental for museums to invest some of their resources into helping their communities deal with current issues. I do not, however, believe that museums should or can afford to abandon their larger mission to become agents of change. Our cause as museum professionals and the mission of our organizations is much larger. It includes social justice and immigration, but also history, art, science, cities, landscape, the evidence of how our cultures are evolving, and so much more.
Many city and history museums, worldwide, appropriately interpret issues of immigration. We illuminate its long and ongoing history through temporary and permanent exhibitions. We present public programs that help our communities understand the contributions of immigrants from hundreds of years ago to recent arrivals that expand our cultural options today. And, we serve as conveners to bring together recent immigrants with established residents to enlarge and enrich community understanding.

  ´´´
 At the same time, however, most museums already have subject-area obligations in addition to those of immigration and social justice. These obligations are equally demanding and deserving of our efforts, energy, and resources. We know these responsibilities well—collecting and preserving our material culture and protecting cultural stories across time and place; convening and facilitating conversations about many topical issues in our communities; and interpreting art, science, history, places, and events as well as our museums’ material and intellectual resources allow.
I believe that these are vital responsibilities that already substantially tap our profession's skill sets and knowledge. To take on the responsibilities of social justice agencies, too, is a stretch beyond most museums’ current capabilities as keepers and interpreters of our communities’ art, science, and history, among the other realms of museum practice. I'm not suggesting that museums avoid presentations that augment and support the work of social justice agencies; museums can be valuable contributors to the work of others. Immigration and other issues of social—and environmental, political, and economic—justice, for which partner agencies within our communities struggle daily, should be major themes for ICOM committees and their affiliated museums. It's debatable, however (hence, this forum essay), that museums—particularly city museums—themselves must become social justice agencies—even as our communities work to understand the realities of 21st-century immigration.

´´´

  I heard some colleagues at the recent ICOM meeting recommend that museums redirect their missions to serve as social justice agencies. I believe it would, indeed, be a misdirection to embark into new skill sets that our staffs, our assets, our p, and our supporters are, to a great extent, mostly unprepared for. They are skills that would require new staff whose focus is not on the museum's role of preserving collections and interpreting knowledge.
most museums already have subject-area obligations
To encourage city—and, perhaps, other types of—museums to move beyond their role as the trusted facilitators of the conversation about their communities and become activists in social justice, it seems, is asking a lot of most museum staff.     We are not all trained, experienced, or, honestly, even able to deliver programs in the complex realms of social justice.
Museums have the agency to give context to change in the past and present of our cities and societies. They do best, I believe, as partners of the agents of change. More to the point, museums’ roles are much larger. We present and contextualize history, art, science, and urban knowledge across decades, even centuries, so they can be drawn upon by audiences today and in the future. I agree that we need to participate fully in the public conversations about where our communities are headed. I do not, however, believe we should allow current issues—be they terrorism, migration, or even climate change—to overwhelm our larger missions. After my long career in the museum field, I am a committed activist in the climate-change issue, but that does not mean I believe my museum should be my personal tool for my activist agenda. I am loathe to see any museum lose its anointed place as the convener of conversations about who and what a community is, where it is going, and how it might get there.
     
     It is good that some museums have elected to redirect their mission or, less radically, put substantial resources into the actual practice of social justice—particularly those with strong financial support from their cities, states, or nations or well-funded by private philanthropists. But for most smaller museums and the vast majority of community and city museums, I believe that remaking their mission as social justice agencies will be a risky business that may win some short term gains but result in the diminution of other vital services they provide their communities.
Agents of change—true, lasting change—require skills that most museum staff do not possess and weren't trained to practice.      The debate over the purpose of museums is drawing attention to skills many of us need to acquire. But I feel we should exercise caution as we pursue this dramatic change in capacity building. We can't and shouldn't presume that the staff of museums must master history, art, or science, plus urban planning, sociology, psychology, and political science so that we can redirect our museums to address issues of social justice. As museum professionals, we need to be fully aware of the need for new knowledge and skills. But, to assume that we be masters of those skills, to become social workers, urban planners, psychologists, developers is to put more expectations on us than most of us are able to meet.
Many colleagues may disagree with these points, but I raise them, as I said at the outset, to initiate a conversation about a matter that, I believe, is elemental to our profession. Discussing this question—hardly the first time it has been raised—helps us to continue to focus and refine our mission. I raise this question, also, because I believe we need to consider more precisely just what we might lose as we do refine that mission. After decades in this field, I believe we need this essential conversation, even more so at this moment when so much is happening within and across our communities worldwide. We don't so much need to change as to better do what we already do well. And, if we really do want to change the purview of our profession and become truly effective actors in the realm of social justice, then we had better be prepared to retrain ourselves and redirect our institutional resources.
   ### In conclusion, I would also be remiss if I did not acknowledge how much I value the conversations with many colleagues around the world that have started around this topic. As we move forward in this discussion, I look forward to its enlarging and enriching our own understanding of our profession and of the role of museums in our own and our shared communities.

    Variously construed, these processes constituted something called the
#scientific method.
  Sometimes thought to have been invented in the 17th century, this was the method by which scientists discovered true generalizations about and explanations for natural phenomena. Or if not exactly true, at least approximations to the truth. And if not certain approximations to then at least highly probable ones. Something of this sort we had all been taught, and we all knew that attempts to refine that understanding of scientific method and what it produced had encountered deep, though isolated, difficulties that were not, after centuries of effort, responding to treatment. It was those difficulties which
drove us to observations of scientific life and to history, and we were
considerably disconcerted by what we found there.
    In the first place, the supposedly solid facts of observations turned to be pliable. The results achieved by different people apparently observing the same phenomena differed from one another, though never a great deal. 
      And those differences-though contained in the same ball park-were often sufficient to affect crucial points of interpretation. In addition the so call

 never to be mere facts, independent

##apparatus 
which itself depended on theory, 
often on the theory that the experiments
were supposed to test. Even when the apparatus could be redesigned
to eliminate or reduce these disagreements, the design process some-
times forced the revision of conceptions about what was being observed.
And after that, disagreements, though reduced, were still present, and
sometimes sufficient to have a bearing on interpretation. Observations,
that is, including those designed as tests, always left room for disagreement about whether some particular law or theory should be accepted.
That space for disagreement was often exploited iscrepancies that to
an outsider looked trivial were frequently matters of deep import to
those on whom the research impinged.
